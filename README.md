# MAS627_ShinyAppProject

The COVID-19 pandemic has had a devastating effect on the economy in the United States. In early March 2020, the first lockdowns began and the stock market plunged. After this initial reaction, however, the market recovered.  

I use some stock information downloaded by myself at the beginning of winter holidays through package **tidyquant**. And I assume an intial position of \$250,000 in cash on 2020-07-01 and invest 6 stocks using investment advice before 1st July from ETF. I track the value of my portfolio using last close prices through the fall to 2020-11-30. At the end of 2020-12-01, I have a position of \$495,201 in cash.  

n shiny I not only display the result of our portfolio, but also show close prices of the indexes and some other stocks. This app ensure people to have a general impression on the change in stock market and make their own portfolio.  

The goal of this project is to make us go from raw data to an interactive web app in R via the shiny package.
