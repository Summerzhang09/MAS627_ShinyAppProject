# Overview

## Introduction

The COVID-19 pandemic has had a devastating effect on the economy in the United States. In early March 2020, the first lockdowns began and the stock market plunged. After this initial reaction, however, the market recovered.  

I use some stock information downloaded by myself at the beginning of winter holidays through package **tidyquant**. And I assume an intial position of \$250,000 in cash on 2020-07-01 and invest 6 stocks using investment advice before 1st July from ETF. I track the value of my portfolio using last close prices through the fall to 2020-11-30. At the end of 2020-12-01, I have a position of \$495,201 in cash.  

n shiny I not only display the result of our portfolio, but also show close prices of the indexes and some other stocks. This app ensure people to have a general impression on the change in stock market and make their own portfolio.  

The goal of this project is to make us go from raw data to an interactive web app in R via the shiny package.  

[**Click here go to shiny app**](https://wenjinsummer-zhang.shinyapps.io/Shinyapp/)

\newpage

## Data
I choose several datasets:  
- The list of stocks containing symbol, company name, last sale price, market caption, ipo, sector and industry from 2020-07-01 to 2020-11-30.  
- All stock prices from 2020-07-01 to 2020-11-30.   
- Values of three indexes(S&P 500, Dow Jones Industrial Average and NASDAQ) from 2020-07-01 to 2021-03-10.  

To be honest, I am really interested in the stock market and want to experience investment. So I downloaded the stock list and stock prices (2020-07-01 -- 2020-11-30) through functions in tidyquant package at the beginning of winter holidays (Downloading these data cost me at least 5 hours). I choose stock data from 2020-07-01 is to find out: 1) Since I use online advice to invest, I can check whether their suggestions are reliable. 2) I try to keep an eye on the change in financial market after the outbreak of COVID-19. Unfortunatly, I find there is something wrong with functions in tidyquant when I try to download the latest data.  
Hence, I will show how I downloaded the data before. And I will clean and display these datasets.  

### Preparation
- I use tq_exchange() to collect the name of all stocks from three stock exchanges (AMER, NASDAQ, NYSE). This dataset has 7535 rows (7535 stocks) and 7 columns.  

```{r}
setwd("C:/Users/rong.li/Desktop/CourseProject/data")
load("stocklist.RData")
kable(stocklist[1:3,])
```

- Then I use tq_get() to download price of all stocks form 2020-07-01 to 2020-11-30. When I continue to download data on 2020-12-01, the connection of tq_get() failes. This dataset contains 654984 rows and 8 columns.  

```{r}
load("C:/Users/rong.li/Desktop/CourseProject/data/stockprice.RData")
kable(stockprice[1:3,])
```

- So, we search closing price on 2020-12-01 of the six stocks we are interested in one by one on [**YAHOO**](https://finance.yahoo.com/) website.   

```{r}
addrevenue <- data.frame(date = "2020-12-01", 
                         ZM = 406.31, 
                         CTVA = 38.31, 
                         PINS = 68.21, 
                         UBER = 49.63, 
                         MRNA = 141.01, 
                         PENN = 70.03)
kable(addrevenue)
```

- I also download values of [S&P 500](https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/%5EGSPC?p=%5EGSPC), [Dow Jones Industrial Average](https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/%5EDJI?p=%5EDJI) and [NASDAQ](https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/%5EIXIC?p=%5EIXIC) to take an overall view of the stock market.  

S&P 500  
```{r}
sp500 <- read.csv("C:/Users/rong.li/Desktop/CourseProject/data/sp500.csv")
head(sp500,3) %>% kable
```


Dow Jones Industrial Average  
```{r}
dj <- read.csv("C:/Users/rong.li/Desktop/CourseProject/data/dj.csv")
head(dj,3) %>% kable
```

NASDAQ  
```{r}
nasdaq <- read.csv("C:/Users/rong.li/Desktop/CourseProject/data/nasdaq.csv")
head(nasdaq,3) %>% kable
```

- Finally I obtain two big datasets (ranging from 2020-07-01 to 2020-11-30) and six closing prices on 2020-12-01. And I get three datasets of three indexes (ranging from 2020-07-01 to 2021-03-10).


### Cleaning
- We eliminate duplicated records of the stocks and stocks without full trading days.  

```{r, result = "hide"}
# delete NAs
# stocklist %<>% na.omit()
stockprice %<>% na.omit()

# filter the stock don't have full trading days
a <- stockprice %>% group_by(symbol) %>% summarise(count = sum(year(date) > 2019))
a %<>% filter(count == 106)
stocklist %<>% filter(symbol %in% a$symbol)
stockprice %<>% filter(symbol %in% a$symbol)
rm(a)
```

\newpage
## Investment
In this part, I use online investment advice that was available at the beginning of July 2020 to make investment decisions and then track my investments through the fall until 1st December.  

### Online Advice
I search some big fund companies and look at their top ten holdings on [**ETF**](https://www.etf.com/channels/ipo) website.  

### Portfolio
From the website, I choose 6 companies that I am interested in and give them different weights. Assume an initial position of $250,000 in cash starting on 1 July 2020. After buying these 6 stocks, we still have \$1.59 left. The holdings are listed in here:  

```{r}
# find the stock I want to hold
melist <- stocklist %>% filter(symbol %in% c("MRNA", "ZM", "UBER", "PINS", "PENN", "CTVA"))
#mestock$company
# "Moderna, Inc."                   "Penn National Gaming, Inc."     
# "Zoom Video Communications, Inc." "Corteva, Inc."                  
# "Pinterest, Inc."                 "Uber Technologies, Inc."

# find the price of six stocks
meprice <- stockprice %>% filter(symbol %in% melist$symbol)

# find the price on 2020-07-01
mepricefirst <- meprice %>% filter(date == "2020-07-01")
#unique(mepricefirst$symbol)
# "ZM"   "CTVA" "PINS" "UBER" "MRNA" "PENN"

# I have $250000 in July 1st
shareratio <- c(0.2, 0.1, 0.1, 0.2, 0.3, 0.1) * 250000
shareset <- floor(shareratio/mepricefirst$close)
#round(sum(shareratio - shareset * mepricefirst$close), 2)
shareset[1] <- shareset[1] + 1
shareset[3] <- shareset[3] + 1
shareset[5] <- shareset[5] + 1
rest <- round(sum(shareratio - shareset * mepricefirst$close), 2)


shareratio <- (shareset * mepricefirst$close) / sum(shareset * mepricefirst$close)
mepricefirst %<>% mutate(share = shareset, amount = shareset * mepricefirst$close, percent = paste(round(shareratio*100), "%"))

df <- mepricefirst[order(mepricefirst$percent, decreasing = TRUE), c(1, 9, 10, 11)]
df$company <- c("Maderna", "Zoom", "Uber", "Corteva", "Pinterest", "Penn")
df %<>% select(symbol, company, share, amount, percent)
df2 <- data.frame(company = "Total", share = " ", amount = sum(df$amount), percent = paste(100, "%"))
rbind(df[, 2:5], df2) %>% kable()
```

Then we use donut chart to see the proportions of each sector.  

```{r, fig.cap = "This shows the proportions of each sector.", fig.height=3}
#some donut graphs
df$labs <- paste0(df$company, " (", df$percent, ")")

df3 <- melist[-5,] #delete PINS
df3 %<>% left_join(df, by = "symbol")
df3 %<>% select(sector, amount, percent)
df3$amount[3] <- 75014.81 
df3$percent[3] <- "30 %"
df3$labs <- paste0(df3$sector, " (", df3$percent, ")")
p3 <- ggdonutchart(df3, "amount",
             label = "labs", 
             lab.pos = "out", 
             fill = "sector",
             lab.adjust = 0,
             lab.font = c(4, "bold", "grey"),
             color = "white",
             palette = "Greens") + 
  theme(legend.position = "none", plot.title = element_text(hjust = 0.5)) + 
  coord_polar(theta = "y", start = 0, clip = "off")
p3
```

As we can see from Figure1, the investment is concentrated in technology and health care sectors.  

### Result
Now I hold 1218 shares of Maderna, 193 shares of Zoom, 1643 shares of Uber, 924 shares of Corteva, 1074 shares of Pinterest and 783 shares of Penn National Gaming and \$1.59 in cash. I track our investments using last close prices through the fall to 2020-12-01 and calculate the value of my portfolio every day.

```{r, fig.cap = "This shows the asset value from 2020-07-01 to 2020-12-01", fig.height=3.5, fig.width=5.5}
# calculate the revenue every day
#unique(meprice$symbol)
# "ZM"   "CTVA" "PINS" "UBER" "MRNA" "PENN"
revenue <- meprice[, c(1, 2, 6)] %>% pivot_wider(names_from = symbol, 
                                   values_from = close)
# forget to download data on 2020-12-01, add the close price of the six stocks
addrevenue <- data.frame(date = "2020-12-01", 
                         ZM = 406.31, 
                         CTVA = 38.31, 
                         PINS = 68.21, 
                         UBER = 49.63, 
                         MRNA = 141.01, 
                         PENN = 70.03)
addrevenue$date %<>% as.Date()
revenue <- rbind(revenue, addrevenue)
rm(addrevenue)

total <- as.matrix(revenue[, 2:7]) %*% as.matrix(shareset) + rest
revenue$total <- as.vector(total)
rm(total)
revenue$ZMr <- revenue$ZM * shareset[1]
revenue$CTVAr <- revenue$CTVA * shareset[2]
revenue$PINSr <- revenue$PINS * shareset[3]
revenue$UBERr <- revenue$UBER * shareset[4]
revenue$MRNAr <- revenue$MRNA * shareset[5]
revenue$PENNr <- revenue$PENN * shareset[6]

revenue %<>% select(date, total, ZM, ZMr, CTVA, CTVAr, PINS, PINSr, UBER, UBERr, MRNA, MRNAr, PENN, PENNr)

# draw picture
ggplot(revenue, mapping = aes(x = date, y = total)) + 
  geom_line() + 
  ylab("revenue") + 
  xlab("month") + 
  ggtitle("The asset values every day") + 
  theme(plot.title = element_text(hjust = 0.5))
```

```{r}
kable(revenue[107, c(1, 2, 4, 6, 8, 10, 12, 14)])
```

Assume an initial position of \$250,000 in cash starting on 1 July 2020. At the end of 2020-12-01, I have a position of \$495,201 in cash.

## Purpose and Function

In shiny I can not only display the result of our portfolio, but also show close prices of the indexes and some other stocks. This app ensure people to have a general impression on the change in stock market and make their own portfolio.  
- You can choose from the sidebar to see the information of all stocks and my portfolio.  
- Information of all stocks contains the index information from 2020-07-01 to 2021-03-10 and various prices of a single stock from 2020-07-01 to 2020-11-30. In control box you can choose which period and stock to display.  
- I use tables and dynamic plots to show portfolio.    
- I provide a way to build your own portfolio. You can choose 3 stocks and set different proportions, then track your portfolio.

## Most Difficult Part

Getting access to high quality data is the most difficult part. Since the functions in tidyquant go wrong, I spend hours trying to use other packages to download data and failed. I can only download the latest values of indexes on YAHOO website.
